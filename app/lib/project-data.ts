    '<p class="c6"><span class="c4 c9 c12">About this project: </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">One of the major barriers to the reliable use of hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes is the substantial well-to-well, batch-to-batch, and line-to-line variability observed during differentiation. This variability limits reproducibility, obscures biological interpretation, and hinders translation to disease modeling and regenerative applications. A central, yet underappreciated, contributor to this problem is the use of poorly defined and biologically variable extracellular matrices that introduce uncontrolled biochemical and biophysical cues during critical fate specification windows.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">In mouse heart, evidence has shown that cardiac progenitors migrate through hypoxic conditions to become second heart field cardiomyocytes. This may have implications in improving the yield of second heart field differentiation which currently exhibits low yield. However, sustaining hypoxic conditions during differentiation is difficult due to the exposure to atmospheric air during media changes. In this project, we aim to develop a plate system that supports the workflow and control of hypoxic conditions during the differentiation of cardiomyocytes, allowing researchers to turn on and off hypoxia. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c9">The central hypothesis</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;of this project is that a well-defined, tunable hydrogel formulation and hypoxic windows with engineered microtopography can reduce extrinsic sources of variability and promote robust, reproducible cardiomyocyte differentiation by precisely controlling the extracellular microenvironment.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c9">The objective of this project</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is to develop and validate a synthetic, modular hydrogel platform that systematically controls matrix composition, stiffness, hypoxic windows &nbsp;and topographical cues to stabilize differentiation trajectories across cell lines and experimental batches. Successful completion of this work will establish a reproducible, scalable substrate for cardiomyocyte production and enable more reliable disease modeling, drug screening, and regenerative medicine studies.</span></p>',

    '<p class="c6"><span class="c4 c9 c12">About this project: </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Human induced pluripotent stem cells&ndash;derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) hold tremendous promise for disease modeling, drug discovery, and regenerative medicine. However, their widespread adoption is fundamentally limited by persistent and poorly understood well-to-well, batch-to-batch, and line-to-line variability in differentiation outcomes. Even when established protocols are followed, differentiation efficiency, cellular composition, and maturation state can vary dramatically, undermining reproducibility and obscuring biological interpretation. This variability arises from a complex interplay between human-in-the-loop execution, poorly defined extracellular matrices, and intrinsic biological differences between cell populations. At present, the field lacks both a systematic understanding of these sources of variation and practical tools to predict, diagnose, and correct failed or suboptimal differentiations.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c9">The long-term goal</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;of this project is to transform iPSC-CM differentiation into a reproducible, predictable, and correctable process. </span><span class="c9">The overall objective</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;of this proposal, termed </span><span class="c2 c11">No More Secrets</span><span class="c2">, is to expose and control the major drivers of variability in chamber-specific cardiomyocyte differentiation protocols developed in the Kamp Lab by Dr. Jianhua Zhang, and to develop actionable tools for early failure prediction, diagnosis of root causes, and revival of failing or poor-quality batches. </span><span class="c9">Our central hypothesis</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is that (i) extrinsic variability arising from protocol execution and the extracellular matrix can be substantially reduced through principled human&ndash;agent interaction design and a fully defined, tunable hydrogel system, and that (ii) intrinsic sources of variability can be measured, stratified, and leveraged to both predict outcomes and guide targeted intervention strategies to rescue differentiation trajectories. This hypothesis is supported by preliminary observations that subtle differences in handling, matrix composition, and early metabolic state strongly bias downstream outcomes.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c9">To test this hypothesis, we will pursue the following specific aims:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(</span><span class="c2 c11">these are also milestones</span><span class="c1">)</span></p><h3 class="c13" id="h.8uwqni4u5dx"><span class="c9 c3 c21">Aim 1: </span><span class="c4 c2 c3">Reduce extrinsic variability by standardizing protocol execution using human&ndash;agent interaction.</span></h3><p class="c8"><span class="c1">We will develop an interactive agent system to guide, coordinate, and log execution of chamber-specific iPSC-CM differentiation protocols, controlling for handling, environmental exposure, and timing precision. Using Dr. Melissa Skala&rsquo;s noninvasive metabolic and optical imaging technologies, we will first stratify and select only batches with similar predicted differentiation potential before they enter these experiments, ensuring that observed effects can be attributed to controllable factors rather than pre-existing intrinsic differences. We will then quantify the impact of standardized execution on well-to-well, batch-to-batch, and line-to-line variability across multiple chamber-specific protocols.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c9">Expected outcome:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A measurable reduction in extrinsic sources of variability and a validated framework for treating protocol execution as a controllable experimental parameter.</span></p><hr><h3 class="c13 c27" id="h.huss9g4pfa4q"><span class="c0"></span></h3><h3 class="c13" id="h.id2vs89802hh"><span class="c9 c3 c21">Aim 2: </span><span class="c4 c2 c3">Eliminate matrix-induced variability by developing and optimizing a fully defined, tunable hydrogel system.</span></h3><p class="c8"><span class="c1">In collaboration with Dr. William Murphy, and guided by Dr. Melissa Skala&rsquo;s noninvasive imaging and metabolic readouts, we will develop a synthetic hydrogel platform with independently tunable biochemical composition, mechanical stiffness, and surface topography.

We will identify matrix formulations that maximize reproducibility and differentiation quality across cell lines and batches.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c9">Expected outcome:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A well-defined, optimized matrix platform that removes a major uncontrolled source of experimental variability and improves robustness of cardiomyocyte differentiation.</span></p><hr><p class="c8 c23"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c8 c23"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c8 c23"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c8 c23"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c9 c3">Aim 3: </span><span class="c4 c2 c3">Predict, diagnose, and revive failing differentiation batches by integrating intrinsic molecular and metabolic signatures.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">In collaboration with Dr. Feliz Yesilkoy, we will use metasurface sensing technologies to longitudinally profile molecular signatures in the differentiation microenvironment, including secreted and consumed factors.

We will then use these models to (i) identify early biomarkers of failure, (ii) diagnose the dominant sources of variability in failed or suboptimal batches, and (iii) design targeted intervention strategies&mdash;such as matrix, timing, or protocol adjustments&mdash;to </span><span class="c9">revive and redirect failing batches toward successful differentiation</span><span class="c1">.</span></p>',
